# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
The purpose of this project is to practice preparing tidy data for later analysis. The data set used is data collected from the accelerometers in Samsung Galaxy S smartphones. A full description of the data set is found here: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones. The data used for the project is here: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip.

## Dataset Description
A group of 30 subjects performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING). 561 variables were calculated from sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphones. This dataset was split into training and testing data set.
